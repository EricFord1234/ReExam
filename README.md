## API Lab group 7

We are in our first year of interaction design, group 7, and here we aimed to do a implementation of prototyping.As we decided to interact with sketch.js
we were asked to understand its meaning and interact with it but not change the product design. 

## What the project does
Sketch.js is an API which provides various prewritten functions and methods which make drawing on the canvas both faster and easier.Features like touch
support are already implemented and ready to be used by simply creating a new event.

## Why the project is useful
The project is useful because Sketch JS provides new to moderate coders a chance to make iterations on a piece of code but at the same time harnessing
a creative aspect. This project could be used by new coders to create something visual, like the background of a screen saver, or even for creative drawing. The project explores the use of javascript code in creating sketch like designs, and includes different creative iterations to make it unique.

## How users can get started with the project
To get started with sketch.js download the zip file containing the source code and link to it inside your code. It’s a fairly simple process but in case
further help is required a “getting started” guide is provided on GitHub. It is intuitive for beginners and easy to interact with.
