 
Bubbles is an example with two main charateristics: the particles in the background and the main bubbles in front. The user can interact by moving the mouse, changing the position of the bubbles. 
 
The piece of code is pretty simple to catch, and it could be changed depending on the needs with relatively short time.

It could be used for interactive medical/chemical products.
