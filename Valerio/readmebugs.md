 
Bugs is in a way similar to pac-man, here the small bugs are eating the big food. However, the code has been changed a bit so that it looks the opposite way around.

The interaction is limited, but once again the mouse plays the main role, as by clicking a point of the screen, new food (or bugs in the new case) are created.

It could be used as a screen for loading pages, for example an antivirus.
