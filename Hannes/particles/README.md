//This is an example (particles) originally created by Justin Windle. [https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js].

The particle example is not something that provides the most functionality but due to it being very easy to modify it can be used by users who don’t have
too much knowledge about programming. Of course, it’s also beneficial for users which already do have previous knowledge about programming because sketch.js
saves them a lot of writing by providing prewritten code. The particle example could be used for exploring interactive screensavers or creating a playful
game which can sometimes be seen on huge screens in various shopping malls.
