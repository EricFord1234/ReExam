//This is an example (Multi-touch drawing) originally created by Justin Windle. [https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js].

This drawing example could be used in different scenarios e.g. a drawing experience for kids which can easily be modified by the parent or a teacher at
school. Due to the implemented functions and methods sketch.js makes it very easy to draw things on the canvas which could be a huge benefit for people that
don’t have the time to write every piece of code themselves or simply don’t have to knowledge to build it completely from scratch. Basically, creativity is
the limit because as the name suggests sketch.js can be used for anything that only requires simple drawings or shapes like creating your own digital
notebook or a simple game made for kids.
